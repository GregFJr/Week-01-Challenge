# Semantic Element Implementation

In this project, I have made changes to the non-semantic HTML elements and made them semantic. Semantic HTML elements are tags that convey meaning to the browser and developers. These elements make the code more readable, accessible, and SEO friendly.

The following changes have been made to the code:

- Replaced `<div>` tags with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` tags to give more meaning to the content of the website.
- Added `alt` attribute to `<img>` tags to improve accessibility.
- Formatted the HTML for better legibility. 

These changes not only make the code more readable and understandable, but they also improve accessibility for users who rely on screen readers and other assistive technologies. Moreover, it improves the search engine optimization (SEO) of the website by providing more meaningful information to the search engines.

In conclusion, the changes made to the non-semantic HTML elements have made the code more semantic, readable, accessible, and SEO friendly.
